Patch Notes:
 - 
To Do's:
1.) Consense and Update code
	i.) See if I can make the health bar of the zombies a rectangle method. it's possible for the final boss, just find a way to move it.
	ii.)See if you can change the font of the upgrade screen. Something with appreciated style could replace the very many classes with organic numbers.
	    New logic would be necessary, but would greatly trim down the game.
2.) add shotgun bow that shoots three, short range bolts
3.) add crossbow that shoots more damaging, higher range, slower reloading bolts.
4.) add selector menu that allows player to switch between unlocked bow types with number keys 1, 2, and 3
5.) create more stages/worlds
6.) slowly introduce these new weapons into the game
7.) actually balance the upgrade system.
8.) buff the new weapons, but limit the amount of ammo for them. Players would have to use it sparingly, but the normal bow would have the regular ammunition.
need to space out the move from scared player to overpowered.
9.) possibly create an arrow storage box(es), which would require players to go to them to pick up more ammunition. Could then add in quiver capaciy upgrade.
10.) possibly add in animations for drawing back the bows.
11.) assuming number ten, require the player to hold down the space bar to draw back the bow. If it is not drawn all the way back, it will not fire. Let go 
     of space to fire (for all regular bows), but for crossbows holding down will reload, then player must release space and press it to fire.
