The purpose of this project is to complete the "create" part of the college board project, and to have a fun game to play. Version 1 was created during freshman year
of highschool for the final project. It has been expanded upon in free time since then.

Version: 2.2

Date: December 5th, 2020

How to start: Open "project"

#### Patch Notes:
 Finally found a way to integrate a more native health bar, but it's not airtight.
 ___
### To Do's:
0.) There is a bug where the upgrade level and health of the superzombie are saved, even when the scenario is reset. Only compiling works.

1.) Consense and Update code

	i.) See if I can make the health bar of the zombies an organic rectangle method. If it's possible for the final boss, just find a way to move it around and attach
	    the objects to the actual zombies. (possibly use "this." keyword?). make sure to include the regualar zombie and superzombie healthbar in one class, taking
	    things like healthBarWidth as class parameters
	- possibly decrease the scope of variables to make run faster? some varibles can just be instance/method variables.
	ii.)See if you can change the font of the upgrade screen. Something with appreciated style could replace the very many classes with organic numbers.
	    New logic would be necessary, but would greatly trim down the game.
	iii.) add notification that extra chance has been used.
2.) add shotgun bow that shoots three, short range bolts

3.) add crossbow that shoots more damaging, higher range, slower reloading bolts.

4.) add selector menu that allows player to switch between unlocked bow types with number keys 1, 2, and 3

5.) create more stages/worlds

6.) slowly introduce these new weapons into the game

7.) actually balance the upgrade system.

8.) buff the new weapons, but limit the amount of ammo for them. Players would have to use it sparingly, but the normal bow would have the regular ammunition.
need to space out the move from scared player to overpowered. Or: unlock more powerful, consumable ammunition

9.) possibly create an arrow storage box(es), which would require players to go to them to pick up more ammunition. Could then add in quiver capaciy upgrade.

10.) possibly add in animations for drawing back the bows.

11.) assuming number ten, require the player to hold down the space bar to draw back the bow. If it is not drawn all the way back, it will not fire. Let go 
     of space to fire (for all regular bows), but for crossbows holding down will reload, then player must release space and press it to fire. 
     
12.) let player pull back bow super far for critical hit, extra fast arrow that deals double damage

13.) Make new bosses, invincible save weak spots
